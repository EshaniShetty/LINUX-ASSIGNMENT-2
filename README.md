# LINUX-ASSIGNMENT-2

Linux Programming Assignment 2: A practical guide to terminal commands, filesystem navigation (absolute vs. relative paths), file search utilities, and permission management using chmod, chown, and chgrp.


Objectives
This repository contains solutions for Linux Programming Assignment 2, focusing on terminal mastery and filesystem administration. 


🛠 Topics Covered

System Identification: Understanding pwd, whoami, and hostname to identify the current directory, user, and host system. 
Path Management: Comparing Absolute Paths (starting from root /) and Relative Paths (relative to the current working directory). 
Command History: Using the history command to display a numbered list of previously executed terminal commands. 
File Search Utilities: Comparing find (real-time filesystem scan) and locate (pre-indexed database search). 
Permissions & Ownership: * Changing file permissions with chmod. 
Modifying ownership and group associations with chown and chgrp. 
Interpreting permission strings like -rw-r--r--. 
Directory Operations: Practical tasks including creating directories (mkdir -p) and generating multiple .txt files (touch) within the /home/student path.
